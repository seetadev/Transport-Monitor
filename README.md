- ICP DAO Engine: https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Monitor/tree/main/icp-dao-engine

 Vehicle DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp.

Vehicle drivers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. 

Vehicle drivers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.

Voting is gasless and the vote is stored with the most recent vote linking to one before.

- Bootable OS using IC Canister for Command and Control Centers: This will enable an OS where secure and transparent workflows for Quotation, Bidding and Invoicing, voting and token management for contract work undertaken by contractors and road developers from Ministry of Road and Transportation, administrators can be undertaken on ICP blockchain Network.

  Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Monitor/tree/main/Command-Center-OS-IC-Canister and https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Monitor/tree/main/IC-dev-tooling


We are developing a backend solution, where the command and control center can boot a Linux OS by uploading it to an IC Canister. 

A virtual disk (An Ubuntu or Debian-minimal PXE image with associated configuration) is uploaded to an IC Canister.

A target host talks to the DHCP server to get the location of the PXE image (ie TFTP server)

PXE requsts from the TFTP Server the files and sectors that it needs

TFTP server translates those requests to talk to the IC canister holding the boot artifacts

On the target host, using PXE, a guest VM will be allowed to boot and load its configuration from the TXE server.

Account Abstraction Plugins for Transport DAO enables customization of verification logic via ICP's Transaction Builder with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs.
Implementation areas of Account Abstraction plugins in Transport DAO using Transaction Builder and Socialcalc:

- Enforcing a spending limit for vital transport assets based on the key used for the transaction.

- Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.

- Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time

Store the hash returned from IPFS to ZKP and scrypt aided solution, ICP network, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using decentralized wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAO tooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users, government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents.

ZKP and scrypt aided ICP solution and license NFT registration module to enable users to register their driving licenses as well as their vehicle registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a vehicle by Vehicle Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Bitcoin account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following ZKP and scrypt aided solution, ICP blockchain and the key tutorial shared at the github website. We are also logging the identities of the driving license owners, their vehicle assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution powered by ICP.
