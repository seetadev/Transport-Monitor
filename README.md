# What it does

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Aeternity Blockchain and analytics tooling, dev tooling and services, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn blockchain, IPFS decentralized storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras – front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ dataset along with ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn blockchain. We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Aleo blockchain to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents. Further, we have developed a DeFi dashboard for the riders and the insurance providers.

Vehicle Spare Parts Marketplace on Aeternity blockchain: Vehicle spare parts NFT marketplace on Aeternity blockchain for NFC tags of spare parts of vehicles, enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets, reduction in counterfeiting of vital spare parts of vehicles and transport infrastructure.

We are developing the marketplace for NFTs based on the tutorial and reference implementations of AEX-141 standard.

# How we built it

We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using Aeternity Blockchain and analytics tooling,  open source video streaming system, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo blockchain solution, Klaytn blockchain, ASDI OpenAQ ((https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/openaq.yaml) and crowdsourcing marketplace enabled by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by SocialCalc.

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn integration, IPFS for snapshots of road incident, Bitcoin based wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, ZKP and scrypt aided solution on Bitcoin based solutions for security and for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn network, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using decentralized wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAO tooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users, government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents.

ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution and Klaytn's license NFT registration module is to enable users to register their driving licenses as well as their vehicle registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a vehicle by Vehicle Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Bitcoin account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Aleo blockchain and the key tutorial shared at the github website. We are also logging the identities of the driving license owners, their vehicle assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution powered by Klaytn.

ZK Transport wallet supports operations like the signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability. We used Zokrates for building the ZK Transport Wallet.
